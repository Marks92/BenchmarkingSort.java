# BenchmarkingSort.java
Benchmarking tests on Insert, Selection, Quick, and Merge sorting algorithms

Benchmarking insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort,
and Quick sort. Each function is tested with a practice array
to make sure the algorithm is working, an almost sorted array, 
as well as a randomly filled array of integers. Iterations are
counted and the total time in milliseconds (ms) is printed.
